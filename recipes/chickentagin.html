        <h2><strong><u>Ingredient:</u></strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 4 chicken thighs (bone-in, skin-on)</li>
            <li> 1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>1 preserved lemon, sliced (optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup green olives (pitted)</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong><u>Instructions:</u></strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large, deep skillet or tagine pot over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken thighs, skin side down, and cook until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Flip the thighs and brown the other side for an additional 3 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot, add the chopped onion and garlic. Saut√© until softened and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the ground cumin, coriander, paprika, ginger, cinnamon, and turmeric to the pot. Stir well to coat the onions and garlic with the spices, and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Return the chicken thighs to the pot, along with any accumulated juices. Add the preserved lemon slices (if using) and pour in the chicken broth. The liquid should come about halfway up the sides of the chicken.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the chicken simmer for 30-40 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
            <li>Add the green olives to the pot and simmer for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.</li>
            <li>Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro or parsley.</li>
            <li>Serve the chicken tagine with couscous or warm bread, and enjoy the flavors of Morocco!</li>
        </ol>
